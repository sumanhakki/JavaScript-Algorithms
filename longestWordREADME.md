# Finding the longest word in a sentence with its length

    This algorthm finds the longest word and displays the word with its length
    * Here by using the array method split(), we are able to store each word in an array
    * We are able to clean the code by iterating over the array with the ES6 addition
      for..of loop and used a ternary operator instead of an if else condition
    * Also, another ES6 additon of template literals by surrounding expression in the        back-tick ` ` , allows us to clean our string concatenation.
