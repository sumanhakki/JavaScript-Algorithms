# Palindrome

    This algorithm is to determine whether a given string is a Palindrome
    - Fisrt we strip all the spaces, periods, and underscores that gives us the pure string value.
    - Second, we store reverse string in reverseStr variable using String and Array methods
    - Third, we check to see if both variables are equal.
