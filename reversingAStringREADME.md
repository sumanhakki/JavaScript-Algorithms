# Reverse A String

    Reverse any given string by using String split() join() and Array reverse() methods, and a for loop.
        - split() gives us a character array of a string
        - reverse() reverses the array
        - join() restores array back to a string
        - last method using a for loop is the cleaner code because the code has     to iterate through the word being passed in only once.
